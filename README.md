# DML Learning Analytics Pre-Workshop Activity

## Introduction to the R programming language  

Welcome to the DML 2017 Learning Analytics Workshop 2017! We are excited to meet you all and start learing together. During the workshop we will be using the R programming language. Before you arrive at Irvine we ask that you install the programming language R and its graphical user interface, RStudio. Installation instructions are below. Once you have installed R and RStudio we would also like you to complete a short activity in RStudio (<10mins). This activity will provide the data we will be analyzing during teh workshop.

## Installing R
* Choose a [download mirror site](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) from the list that is close to you geographically  
* Downloaded the version of R that is appropriate to your operating system
* Install R in a manner appropriate to your operating system ([MacOSX](https://youtu.be/Ywj6yNfc5nM), [PC](https://youtu.be/5ZbjUEg4a1g))

## Installing RStudio (Graphical User Interface for R)
* Download the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Install RStudio in a manner appropriate to your operating system ([MacOSX](https://youtu.be/Ywj6yNfc5nM), [PC](https://youtu.be/5ZbjUEg4a1g))

## Pre-Workshop Activity
* Once you have installed both programs, open RStudio (RStudio will automatically open R at the same time)
* R is modular, you install mini-programs called packages within it like apps on your phone to do specific tasks, in this activity we will be using the Swirl package. Swirl is a teaching tool for learning R, it comprises questions and answers and a bit of AI (for positive reinforcement)
* Install the Swirl package by typing `install.packages("swirl")` in the console window (located on the left hand side of the RStudio interface)
* Once we have installed the package we need to turn it on, we do this by inputing the code `library(swirl)`
* Now we need to load a lesson into Swirl, to do this cut and paste the following code into the console window:
